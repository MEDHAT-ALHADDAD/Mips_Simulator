Graphical MIPS Simulator using java (computer Architecture)

MIPS Data path and Control Unit Simulator is software designed to simulate the flow of data inside a MIPS processor. 
This involves the decoding of assembly language programs into binary instructions, 
showing the exact path of these instructions through the different components that make up the processor, 
to get the desired program output. The software was written in Java. It supports all the primary instructions supported by MIPS,
in addition to more instructions as a bonus feature. The software also has a GUI with an assembler.
The instruction format is partially like the format originally supported by MIPS, 
plus we added an GUI with an assembler plus we added 6 test programs with their c code.
